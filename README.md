# Python-Antique Car Search 

 
Your task is to write a Python program that would open up a csv database of Antique cars from this link: 
 
http://web.pdx.edu/~gerbing/data/cars.csv 
 
You will only need to read the Model, MPG, Horsepower and Origin columns from the database [​20 points​]. Given the information from the database, implement the following features: 
 
[50 points] Feature #1: Seach Car This feature allows user to search the database based on the minimum mile per gallon (MPG) and Horsepower. Once user inputs the minimum required MPG and horsepower, the program should display the cars that match the criteria.  
 
[50 points] Feature #2: Best and Worst Green Cars This feature would report the average MPG of all the cars in the database along with the car that has the best and the worst MPG.  
 
[50 points] Feature #3: Car Origin Report We time to time would like to see how many american, european, japanese, taiwanese etc. cars in the inventory. Count how many different origins the cars are from in the database and display how many from each origin do we have.
